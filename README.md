Molecular characterisation of human rabies in East Africa - a case series report and phylogenetic investigation
Rabies remains a major public health problem in East Africa where the disease is rarely laboratory-confirmed. We use virus sequence data to enhance investigations of five human cases, revealing important implications at individual, healthcare, and societal levels. The cases differed in their epidemiological context and care: three of the bite victims did not receive post-exposure vaccination; one received only the first dose while the last was vaccinated following a timeline not recommended by WHO. These discrepancies raise concerns about health-seeking behaviour, competency of healthcare professionals in handling rabies-exposures and accessibility and effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis as administered in these settings. Our investigation confirms dog-mediated rabies as the cause of these deaths, highlighting the regional circulation of rabies within domestic dog populations. We conclude that urgent action is needed to improve awareness of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, ensure its accessibility and appropriate administration, and for coordinated dog vaccination to control dog-mediated rabies.![image](https://github.com/Gurdeepjaswant/EA_human_rabies_case_series/assets/61788964/a7187a54-b754-43f7-a429-ce313fc7aadc)
